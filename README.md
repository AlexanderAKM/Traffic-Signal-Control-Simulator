# Traffic Signal Control Simulator

## Overview
This Traffic Light Control Simulator is designed to facilitate the study and improvement of traffic light control in urban environments. By leveraging reinforcement learning techniques, the simulator aims to optimize traffic flow and reduce vehicle waiting time at intersections.

## Authors
- Alexander Müller
- Cezar Bulancea

Together for a Reinforcement Learning course at the University of Groningen, we implemented a DQN, A2C, and Stochastic agent for a 2 way intersection. 

## Current Maintainer
- Alexander Müller

Some ideas that I am either currently working on or want to implement in the future are:
1. Finetuning DQN and A2C.
2. Experimenting with the traffic flow to see how that impacts the learning of the different algorithms.
3. Implementing PPO and other algorithms.
4. Experimenting with other (more diverse) environments.

## Environment
The simulator uses the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) as its underlying environment, specifically tailored for reinforcement learning applications. The SUMO-RL environment was initially created by Lucas N. Alegre. You can find the code at github here: https://github.com/LucasAlegre/sumo-rl
