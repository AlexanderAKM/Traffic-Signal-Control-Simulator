class Agent:
    # Maybe create a universal agent class and then write a few
    # algorithms such as Q-learning, DQN, SARSA and compare them

    # Or it can be even nicer to make a separate class for every algorithm 

    # For Q-learning we can opt to implement different algorithm on 
    # how to choose the action (epsilon greedy, greedy, etc) or just incorporate
    # an algorithm and leave it like this (easier but not so complex)
